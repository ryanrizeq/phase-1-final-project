## Simply Simple Cocktails

## Description
Simply Simple Cocktails is a web application that allows a user to search for easy to make cocktail recipes. Specifically, all recipes generated from this web application will contain only three ingredients or less. 

To use this website, a user can:
    1. Navigate to the search bar
    2. Enter in a keyword for the name of a cocktail (for example, "margarita", "strawberry", "rum", "beach", etc.)
    3. Click the "Search" button or press "return" on the keyboard

If cocktails with names containing the searched keyword and having only three ingredients or less are found, the name of those cocktails will display on the screen. To view a picture of the cocktail, the drink glass, ingredients & measurements, and recipe instructions, the user can click on the cocktail name. 

Further, to complete another search, all the user needs to do is return back to the search bar and execute another search with a new keyword.
